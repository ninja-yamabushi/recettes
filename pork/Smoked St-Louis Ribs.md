1.
	Ideally, you will smoke or slow roast your ribs using the 3-2-1 technique. 
	This is the easiest rib technique to master and provides fairly consistent results. 
	Prepare and season the ribs with your favorite rub. 
	Preheat your smoker, charcoal grill, or gas grill to 225°F - the ideal temperature for cooking ribs. 
	Smoke/slow cook for 3 hours using indirect heat. 
	Wrap the ribs in foil with some liquid and continue cooking for 2 hours. 
	Unwrap the ribs and cook one more hour, at which point you can sauce and sear, or add another 30 to 60 minutes to slow-cook the sauce on.
2.
	The accepted finished temperature of pork is 145°F, however, this has not given the collagen inside your ribs time to become gelatin for that perfect bite. 
	That begins to happen when temperatures inside the meat reach 165°F. 
	Continue cooking ribs until they reach around 195°F to 203°F for maximum render. 
	You can keep an eye on this using a meat thermometer between the bones, however, you need to exercise caution as the meat nearest the bones will register as warmer than the meat in the middle. 
	It can be a tough balance with thicker probe thermometers.
