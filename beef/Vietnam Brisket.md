### Brisket  

- Heat the grill to medium high temp and char the onion, garlic, and ginger.
- Add the charred vegetables to a blender with the remaining marinade ingredients and blend until a smooth and constant sauce forms.
- Trim excess fat off the brisket and make crosshatch slits into the fat and through a little of the flesh of the brisket with a sharp knife.
- Place the brisket in a large deep pan and pour the marinade over it, rubbing it into the flesh.
- Place in the refrigerator to marinate overnight.
- Heat the grill to medium heat.
- Place the brisket, fat side up, in a large hotel pan and cover with foil.
- Put the pan on the grill turning the flame below the brisket to low, and cook for 4 hours, until very tender, add water to the pan as needed while cooking to prevent burning.
- Flip the brisket ½ way through.
- Remove the brisket from the pan and place it directly on the grates set at high heat and sear for a few minutes per side.
- Remove and set aside to slice.  
  
### Pineapple Nuoc Mam  
- Add the water and pineapple to a blender and blend until smooth.
- Use a fine mesh strainer to strain half of the pineapple mixture.
- To a medium size bowl add the chilis, garlic, sugar, lime juice and fish sauce. 
- Stir in ½ the pureed pineapple to that mixture and stir to combine.  
  
### To Assemble  
- Cook the rice noodles according to package instructions.
- Lay the noodles on a serving platter and top with sliced brisket. 
- Pour the Nuoc-Mon over the top and garnish with the herbs, peanuts and shredded lettuce.
